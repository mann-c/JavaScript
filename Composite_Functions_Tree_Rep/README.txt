This program can represent any composite function with two or fewer variables using a binary tree. It can also convert any binary tree into its respective composite function. 

To test the program, the composite function in line 200 can be changed to any composite function that is defined using two or fewer variables. 
Examples of possible functions:
f(x(k(l,o)),g(n,m))
f(l,y(x,g))
l(f,x)
m(n,u(l,v(w,(yas))))
